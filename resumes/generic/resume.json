    "summary": "Gabe was born and raised in Redmond, Washington and graduated from Emerson High in 2011, though he actually spent his last two years in the Running Start program. As a teenager he developed deep interests in computer programming and weather prediction. One thing lead to another and he ended up in a CS Masters program after completing his degree in Atmospheric Sciences. During this time he started developing a new programming language for the web. The painstaking work with LR grammars sparked Gabe's interest in developing efficient parsing algorithms and tools, especially for the web. Start talking about parsing or programming language semantics with Gabe and you're in for a long conversation.",
